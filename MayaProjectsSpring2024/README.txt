I did a lot of retopoing, the re-retoping to test out where the best points to pinch would be, but It's hard to tell at this point in the process. The scale texture was kind of difficult to get, but I  ended up just painting over a bumpy texture for it. The fins still look weird to me, but I don't have any more time to mess with them, so maybe at some other time. The fish has a bit of contrast, because the colors are bright and vibrant, but  his eyes are angry. I also tried to add more of a crazy old man look by givining him eyes that look like they are losing the ability to see well.
